Starting with Golem, 2wens2ndwd to O

First section: the Hellspires.
    Follow the path north, up, west, north, east through wild men and winter wolves. The room labelled "Peace" is not a
    peace room, and wild men will wander into it. Dragg is not aggro, but does go on and on. Collect the icy key from
    the white dragon past Dragg before moving on. The Golem has no key and is not aggro.
Second section: the halls.
    From Golem, go 2wens2ndwd to the halls. Place a pp after entering the sink hole. Progession requires killing Order,
    who is not aggro, and the icy elemental past him, who is aggro. The ice queen is not required. Kill the knight of
    the ancients, and head two up. A trigger should deposit you one south of a room with a wooden sign - place a pp
    here.
Third section: Tanisbwana.
    Two villages are at war, tech'opi to the west and bwani to the east. You can ignore both: proceed north onto the
    river, south at the first fork, and west at the second to visit U'tella and relieve her of a Quill. She is not
    aggresive, so feel free to spell her up first. Take the Quill east and into the lost valley. On the west side
    the Quill will unlock down in the ancient temple, leading to the Immaterial Knight and the Guardian of Honor. They
    aren't aggro but will assist each other, so dust one and kill them separately. The Guardian of Honor will yield
    the sigil of Orde. Head back to the river and follow it to the north. Climb up to the ancient version of the Golem.
    You can kill the Golem if you like, but you don't need to. The sigil will unlock the field, providing access to
    the vortex. Enter the vortex to reach the ruined city - the vortex isn't always reliable, so expect some misports.
Fourth section: the ruined city.
    This section is loot candy. Collect your prizes from the various pinatas scattered around. Cessephenes is hidden
    at the top of the eastern tower, and hits hard, but the rest are a reward for making it so far. Once the town has
    been cleaned up proceed west from the market square, and enter the Gardens of Peril. The loot pinata party continues
    here with the garden horror, Serafina, and Credadgix; one room is a noexit trap, obviously named. Once you've
    taken what you like, move through the one-way exit onto the norther ruined causeway from the Gardens. A roper has
    the key to the heart at the northern end; another has likely snatched up several Krater of Pyros keys to lead down
    into the maze. Collect any further loot you'd like from Vetvarilus first, then travel wd2eunewswusnu through the
    maze and east onto Spykros in the final section.
Fifth section: the temple of Txachamitxchual.
    This section is straightforward. Clear out the trash, killing the Queen of the Spiders on the second floor. Most of
    the section can be portalled to, save a few rooms south of Txachamitxchual, so set a pp somewhere convenient. When
    the trash is cleared, kill the mad priest. Be sure you check the rooms east and west of Txachamitxchual for more
    trash, else it'll wander in at the worst possible time.

Enter via Three of Swords. From Samsera, 10esed4e2se2dw

Zone is lousy with death traps. Some rooms sound a bit death-trap-ish but are not. Some rooms don't
sound very dangerous but are DTs.

The various trash mobs pick up items and likely have collected junk from previous clears of the zone.

Room X is !sound !magic !summon. Kind of annoying.

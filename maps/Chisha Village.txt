Need to kill waitress (in a)

From Samsera: 16w6swse14s7e2s4e

Hugo, the bartender's quest:
    Hugo, the bartender tells you, 'the ingredients needed for brewing are some special fungus, barley, a cask,'
    Hugo, the bartender tells you, 'some malt, and some yeast.    '
    Barley must be fresh from the fields, not the stuff from Lucia.

Sisters: Yun (51 mu), Yumi (51 cl), Yuiri (51 sl)

Chris Lightfellow:
    Flexo tells you, 'and say take me to alma kinan'

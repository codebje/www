9 A small clearing.
  You are in a small clearing in the shadow grove. There is chared grass
underfoot, and the signs of fire here and there. It is almost as if the
plant life shuns this spot. The shadowy mist hovers all around, obscuring
your view into the grove.
  A small path leads north to some shadowy structure. All other exits are
shrouded in shadowy mist.

A Entrance to the High Tower
  You have reached the entrance to the high tower of sorcerery. The
tower looms above you at an incredible height. It seems to disappear
into the storm clouds above.
  A diamond gate is to the north, guarded by a huge golem. The trail
back south has disappeared behind you.

B Inside the High Tower of Sorcerery
  You are inside the high tower of sorcery. The sight is truly amazing.
From here, it is obvious that somehow, the tower is much larger on the
inside than it is on the outside. Young mages walk about, completely
oblivious to your presence.
  Exits lead north to the common room, west to the dinning room, east to
a plain hallway and back south through the gate.

C Dining Room
  You are in the dinning area of the student mages. From the number of
tables and chairs here, you can see that this room could easilly seat
several hundred people. It is oddly deserted here, obviously not meal time.
  Exits lead west to the kitchen, and back east.

D the kitchen
  You are in a small kitchen. All the usual kitchen type utensils and
equipment is here, including some not so usual ones. Among the later,
a huge black oven against one wall, it must be at least 12 feet high.
Opposite the oven is an equally enormous meat locker, large enough to
comfortably store several hapless adventurers no doubt. In the middle of
the room, hanging in mid-air is a spice rack.

E Common Room
  You are in the common room. There are many apprentice warlocks here
talking and resting, playing games, comparing notes. Obviously they
are taking a break from their rigorous studies. There are benches,
tables and a small water fountain here, otherwise the room is quite
unremarkable.
  Exits lead off in all directions.
A large fountain is here gurgling out an endless stream of water

F The Magic Shop
  You are in the High Tower's store of magic. Tatorious stands behind
the counter, selling all sorts of herbs, parchment and other reagents
used in magical studies.
  The only exit leads back east to the common room.

G Mages Tavern
  You are in mages tavern. The air is smokey and filled with the smells
of foriegn food and drink. The other patrons pay you little heed, as
they obviously have more interesting things to contemplate. Strick the
bartender is here waiting to take your order.

H Dark Hallway
  You are in a dark hallway. It is apparent that this area is seldom
used by the regular occupants of the tower. Dust covers the floors
here.
  The faint outline of a trapdoor can be seen in the dust.

I Below the trapdoor
  You are below the trapdoor. It is very dark and dusty here, very little
light filters through from above. A faint sound of dripping water can be
heard in the distance below.
  A rope ladder leads down.

J A damp intersection
  You are in a damp intersection of what seems to be the basement of the
tower. The sound of running water can be heard comming from the south,
other than that, an almost tangable stillness fills the air.
  Passages lead off in all directions, and a ladder leads up.

K A dark passage
  You are in a dark passage, which comes to an abrubt stop at what appears
to be a cave-in to the west. It is certainly unpassable, and perhaps quite
dangerous just being this close.
  The only exit leads back east.

L A dark passage
  You are at the end of a dark passage which ends in a stout wooden door.
Other then through the door, the only apparent exit is back the way you
came.

M A dark passage
  You are at the end of a dark passage. A half opened door is to the east,
shedding soft light around the edges. Faint snoring sounds can be heard
behind the door.
  Exits lead east through the door, or back west.

N The Jailor's office
  You are in the Jailor's office. It is rather messy here. Judging by the
sleeping form of the Jailor on duty, you can surmise that very few, if any
prisoners survive long enough to spend much time in these dank dungeons.
  The only exit leads back west.

O The stagnant pool
  You are at the edge of a stagnant pool of water. The smell here is quite
nauseating. This is apparently where the denizens of the tower dispose of
their garbage. Faint gurgling can be heard from benieth the surface of the
pool.
  Exits lead back north, or perhaps for the very adventurous, down into the
pool.

P A dark cell
  You are in a dark cell. Straw and dirt cover the floors here, it is
very dark. Someone, or something seems to be chained to the far wall.
  The only exit is back south.

Q Below the stagnant pool
  As you dive beneith the putrid waters, you feel a strong tug and a
whirlpool drags you under.
  You are sucked into blackness and you feel your lungs begining to
burst from lack of oxygen!
Just as you feel your life fading, you notice a change in direction, and
start to float to the surface.
(up to The Tunnel Maze)

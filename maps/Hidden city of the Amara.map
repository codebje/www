--- notes

Octypus in 1 will give mages/amara a pearl, send others to sleep.

No-exit room down from D, E, G
Peace room in C, J
Gnurl's shop in a is not underwater, !magic

First layer exits shift, Gnurl is a "compass" - go one cardinal past whatever direction his shop is, eg if he's north
go east.
Tiax tells you, 'its de2s2ene from there'

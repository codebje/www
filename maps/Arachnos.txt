a The Tenuous Strand
     Very windy here since it goes up into the sky somewhat.
Still, it's safe enough to move around.

b The Elder Wormkin's Room
     A more mature wormkin it seems resides here.  Various tomes of
arcane lore clutter the area, along with shards of armor and weaponry.

c The Base of the Web
     Large strands connect at this point.  The node shimmers and
flickers within the ether.  You see many flying creatures--
insects, pegasi, and dragon wormkins--navigate the dangerous
passages of the web.  Exits go in many directions.

d On A Cloud
     Rather thick in consistency.  You realize this is not
a typical cloud, but it might be the nest of an aerial creature.

e Above the Clouds
     You can see all of Midgaard in this ethereal web.  Many
of the larger dragons that do wish to fly seem to fly
away from the sticky strands of the web.

f A Link in the Ethereal Web
     This is another link in the ethereal web.  Various creatures
seem to get caught (or hypnotized) by its sticky strands.

g The Young Wormkin's Crib
     A playpen of sorts, with maggots of wasps and other baby vermin
lying about.  You feel that humans have been played with here too,
and eaten later.  You sense that the maker of this place has
an appetite for dragon meat, and uses this room as a breeding
area.

h Through the Trees
     This part of the web intersects through the branches of some
trees.  Various leaves and other debris that the many drones
have not picked up yet lie here.

i Another Tree Limb
     Once again the web crosses another tree limb.  To the side you
see the possible entrace to another creatures lair.

j The Bird Spider's Lair
     This is a big game hunter among most spiders.  Crush jewels
and other weapons suggest the inhabitant must have powerful jaws.
Beware!

k A Link in the Ethereal Web
     This is another link in the ethereal web.  Various creatures
seem to get caught (or hypnotized) by its sticky strands.

l The Ki-Rin Chamber
     A wise ki-rin was entrapped here many years ago.  It is from her
that the ruler of this realm zaps his magical strength.

m On The Web
     RRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAARR!  You hear the roar
of a powerful beast.  Dragon, you think.  You shiver in your boots
as you tiptoe on this section of the web.

n The Quiet Tree Top
     Here is a quiet tree top.  Downwards you can see a familiar path
that may lead back to Midgaard.

o Up in the tree
You are hanging on the outside of a huge tree trunk covered in a sticky
substance.  Directly to the west is an immense spider web suspended between
numerous of the giant trees including the one you are hanging on.  To the north
is what looks like a large webbed entrance.
(In Haon-Dor)

p A Link in the Ethereal Web
     This is another link in the ethereal web.  Various creatures
seem to get caught (or hypnotized) by its sticky strands.  To
the north you sense the heavy breathing of a fiery animal.
4.rook

q A Link in the Ethereal Web
     This is another link in the ethereal web.  Various creatures
seem to get caught (or hypnotized) by its sticky strands.  A single
spider line lies to the north, while ghastly seemings are due
southward.  The grim entrance of Arachnos' Lair is downward.

r The Single Spider Line
     A single spider line supports you once more.  As you look
across the ether you seen a single shack up ahead with a light in
the window.  You sense a great evil coming from the north and feel
inclined to go back on the ethereal web and take your chances there.

s The Single Spider Line
     A single spider line supports you once more.  The shack comes
closer into view and you are even more inclined to go back now.

t The Hermit's Corner
     Here you see evidence of a vagrant's abode.  The shack is to the
north, if you dare enter it.  You get the sneaking feeling you should
go back now.  The skies above you darken and roar with the laughter
of thunder.

u The Path of Betrayal
(The Coven clan halls)

w The Entrance to the Arachnos' Lair
     All strands inevitably lead here, the center of the web, the
entrance to Arachnos' Lair.

x Mahatma's Inescapable Trap (Death)

y Yevaud's Lair
     Yevaud, the Usurper of Midgaard, resides here.  A voice cries
out, "BEWARE, the Usurper of Midgaard lives here!  FLEE while you can!"
But even Yevaud has his master...or so you deduce.

z The Sticky Chamber
     You can still bail out since your knees are shaking from the
anticipation (or is it fear?).  The sky is clear on this strand of
web, surprisingly unsticky.  The strand does not vibrate like the
others.  A few ballooning spiders pass by, cackling "You're gonna
die, you're gonna fry.  Good bye!"

A The Great Door
     Before you you see a large, web-like door.  Various designs
of ancient runes and names of Midgaard heroes are etched into
the webwork.  Perhaps lists of victims?  You can't tell.

B Entrance to the Donjonkeep
     A dark path at the end of the web strand, you see ahead
a torch lit chamber where the souls of unavenged adventurers
come and gnash their teeth.  The howls and screams of many echo
through the hall ways.  You see one definite path ahead.

C The Guardian's Room
     A chair sits here for a tireless guardian who ensures that no
soul escapes.  The room is undecorated.

D Realm of the Hopeless
     Here you see many misguided souls who think they still live.
They search for those who killed them without warrant, and seek the
free souls of living beings to inhabit and perhaps adventure once
more.
(marker: one coin)

E Realm of the Hopeless
     Here you see many misguided souls who think they still live.
They search for those who killed them without warrant, and seek the
free souls of living beings to inhabit and perhaps adventure once
more.
(marker: a blue potion)

F The Donjonkeep
     No souls have ever lived in this place.  The wails of slaves
and the howls of wolves are the only way you can describe the sounds
you hear.  The walls are thin and wispy.  The only light you receive
is the shimmering from the strand of the ethereal web you used to get
here.

G Inside the Webbing
   You feel your feet sticking to the floor as you walk into this room.  The
walls, floor, and ceiling are made from ethereal webbing.  An uneasy feeling
comes over you as you realize the only exit is back through the way you came.
For a moment you realize what it would feel like to be entombed in a web.

H On the spider web
You are balancing carefully on the giant sticky threads that holds the giant
web in place.  To the east is a giant tree trunk and to the west is an entrance
to a cave-like structure made from many layers of spider web.

I The Den of the Queen Spider
You are inside a cave-like structure that seems to be made entirely from
countless layers of spider web.  Temperature and humidity is very high making
it hard to breathe the foul air that lingers here.  The walls are covered with
open cocoons.

J Webbed Entrance
     Sticky, sticky, sticky!  The ground is cluttered with leaves, decayed
remains of webbed crickets, beetle, rats, dogs (?), and even humans.
You begin to wonder about what lies ahead.  The air is damp here,
and even the little light that shines through the canopy seems
absorbed into the webbing.

K Webby Passage
     You find that footing here is very good, almost too good.  The
limbs are coated with cobwebs and seem unusually strong for tree
branches.  Paths lead in four directions.  The eastward path goes
down a bit.

L Wasp Hive
     Drones scuttle about in this room.  The cells on the walls
are honeycomb in shape and many of the maggots and wasps you see
have fang-marks on their bodies.  You sense some order in their markings.

M Webby Passage
     Another webby passage, all sticky and wet.  Tiny ballooning
spiders fill the air.  It seems that these young ones are newborns.

N Beneath the Busy Path
     You here the sounds of crawling arachnids above.  The rhythms of
the footsteps suggest a primitive order in there movement.  The light
seems brighter upwards.

O On the Busy Path
     Spiders, spiders, everywhere!  It is almost ant-like in efficiency
with one big difference.  The spiders here are carrying ant-corpses,
as well as rats, wolves, and humans.

P A Split in the Path
     As always, there is a split in the road.  One road is strewn
with cricket feelers.  The other is well-kept and suitable for smooth
travelling.  The webbing that was prevalent in earlier rooms is almost
non-existant now.

Q Fuzzy Tree Limb
     You are on a "fuzzy" tree limb.  Interesting, since the branches
seem to have "hairs" sprouting from its bark.  As you look
closer you see millions of aphids covering each limb.

R Tree Trunk
     You feel that you can rest here safely.  There is evidence of
webbing here, but it is of a finer quality.

S Tree Lair Entrance
     It seems the inhabitant of this place does not web her
victims, as evidenced by the remains before you.  The area
is cluttered with desiccated corpses, apparently bitten
but unwebbed, and drained of their life juices.

T Wolf Spider Lair
     Very dark, as all lairs of spiders are.  Not much of furnishings
save an exit.  The wolf spider keeps no corpses here, but rather
throws them out at her leisure.

U The Webless Path
     Strange.  No webbing here.  In fact, no sounds whatsoever.
The path continues northward, where you find that you may have to
tightrope your way across a ravine.

V Above the Ravine
     Stranger still.  Your feet get a real firm grip on the spiderline.
You are above a deep ravine.  This line connects you between two trees.
Below you can see a prismatic web with lots of animal bones caught in it:
some bear and small deer bones in fact.  No human skeletons are visible
(yet).

W The Rainbow Web
     This is the rainbow web--each strand, each link, a hue of violently
sharp colors and contrasts.  The resident here seems to have a command
of light as well.

X The Web Forest
     The trees here take on a different appearance--they are not trees
anymore, but disjointed make-shift silken made shafts, sticky to the touch,
and webby in texture.  This is another world it would appear.

Y The Slave Pit
     You have entered the slave pit.  A voice blares in the distance,
"Get back to work, maggots!"  Rails upon rails of mined gold and silver
clutter the trail beneath you.

Z The Tether Path
     Another tether path just like the rest of them.  Surprising well
-lit by the golden orbs that hang from the sides, you can see the paths
become finer and finer in quality.

0 A Road Crossing
     Another shifty little strand of webs, almost ethereal in nature.

1 A Leader Strand
     This strand is weightier, more sturdy.  It shimmers as you step on
it.  You are definitely not in the Midgaardian realms anymore.  Just
where you are you can't tell.  It feels like you're moving through
ether.  You can still get back down to more surer lands.

2 The Entrance of the Ethereal Web
     You are at the entrance to ethereal web.  Flickering in and out,
in and out, each strand reveals a different hue from black to green
to blue.

3 The Lair of Arachnos
     This is the lair of the Empress Spider, Arachnos.  A lavishly
adorned rainbow web, her lair allows her to move to any universe
she wishes by using her magical strands to the Prime Material Plane.
Coffers upon coffers of gold, magical jewels and gems await.  Unfor-
tunately Arachnos is a baggy spider too, and webs all her treasures
to her beautiful silken body.

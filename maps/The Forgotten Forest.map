1 A forgotten beach
   The sea has eroded the cliff to the south to provide the island with a small
beach here. The saltwater laps the shore in a rhythmic pattern and you have no
doubt that at high tide there would be no beach at all here. A large stone
juts out from the beach here and would probably be here even at the highest
tide however.
Obvious Exits :  West

2 A forgotten beach
   You stand on the beach of some long forgotten land. A light mist surrounds
you and you feel as if you had taken a step back in time. A volcano, a rarity
these days, can be seen in the distance, past a very thick forest. The Forest
is strangely quiet almost as if its watching you to determine your intent.
You conclude that you may have found the lost Forbidden Island.
Obvious Exits :  East South West

3 Entering the enchanted forest
   The forest and the mist seem to close in around you. You leave the beach
behind and enter this strange forest. The trees are larger than any you have
ever seen before, they rival even those of the forest of Han-dor. Animals you
have, until now, only seen in books seem to be commonplace here.

5 A forgotten beach
   The sea has eroded the cliff to the south to provide the island with a small
beach here. The saltwater laps the shore in a rhythmic pattern and you have no
doubt that at high tide there would be no beach at all here.
Obvious Exits :  East South(3) West

6 The forgotten forest
   You are in the middle of a forgotten forest on a forgotten island. Strange
creatures hide in the shadows just out of eyesight. Strange beasts lurk just
off in the distance leading you to wonder if they are staying away out of fear
or because they are waiting for an opportune time to strike.
Obvious Exits :  East South

7 Deep in the forest
   The forest surrounds you as you travel deeper into its depths. Shadows and
sounds from the shadows keep your nerves on edge. Your never sure when you're
going to run into some strange creature that makes this forest its home.
Obvious Exits :  North South

8 A forest clearing
   The clearing allows you to once again see the light of day. Its large enough
for a large giant to fit in and your not sure if its wise to leave
yourself so exposed and visible, for you can't help but feel you're being
watched from the shadows.
Obvious Exits :  North South West

9 Deep in the forgotten forest
   The forest is never quiet. There is always some creature calling out to its
group for protection, or screaming out in terror as it is attacked and dies.
Such is the way in nature, only the strong survive. Judging by all the screams
you don't stand a chance.
Obvious Exits :  East South

A Entrance to a Village
   You are at the entrance to a small centaur village. These strange mythical
beasts are quite intelligent at watch you calmly, for they know that you are
an intruder. However, they are confident that you pose no real threat and
apparently if you did anything wrong they would certainly kill you without
thinking twice!
Obvious Exits :  North South West

B The Village Square
   This is where the centaurs meet to relax and to eat a common meal. They are
quite communal creatures, eating and relaxing, even playing together! There
games are complex but some are simple, like archery contests with the winner
receiving a small prize and the support of the entire family. A large fire pit
dominates the square for cooking and partying at night.
Obvious Exits :  North East South West

C The Chiefs Home
   This spartan house (more like a hut actually) is the home of the village
chief. Sparcly decorated, it houses only necessities, it shows that these
creatures have no need for worldly goods and are not interested in money and
power. The cultures are still the hunter gathers of the world, and aren't
complaining either.
Obvious Exits :  South
The corpse of a centaur leader is lying here.

D A Centaur's Hut
   Strange creatures have strange houses, and this hut is no different!
Furniture is almost nonexistent and what there is, is certainly different!
However, there are some pictures on the wall and of course a fire pit to keep
the hut warm at night.
Obvious Exits :  East
Obvious Exits :  North

E Deep within the forest
   The forest surrounds you and you're not quite sure how you're going to get
out. The twisted paths make it impossible to tell the exact way you came and
the centaurs trampling over your tracks rule out using that method to
determine if you have or haven't been here. Everything seems to be working
against your getting out.
Obvious Exits :  North East South

F A dead end in the forest
   The forest path you have been following once again stops for some unknown
reason. Whoever or whatever created these paths seems to have no idea where it
was going. Paths start and stop in the middle of nowhere with no reason why.
It wouldn't be that bad if you knew where you were going or where you've been,
but you've been lost for several hours now and you're getting just a bit
tired of this.
Obvious Exits :  East
Obvious Exits :  North

G Near another volcano
   Another volcano extends to the south-east of here. Unlike the other one
however this one appears to be inactive for some time. Not that you'd rather
it be active! One volcano threatening to blow you to bits is enough to deal
with. It is curious, however, that only one of the volcanoes is active. Wonder
why?
Obvious Exits :  North South West

H Turn in the path
   No path in this forest is straight, hence they all must make a turn
sometime. This is the case now. There is no indication why the path makes this
turn, perhaps the trees wear too thick up ahead, or perhaps the creature that
made the path wanted to get a drink from the river to the east. The reason
doesn't matter all that matters is you must change your direction.
Obvious Exits :  North West

I End of the forest
   The forest ends and to the south you can see the beginning of a large, foul
smelling swamp. Traversing the swamp will be difficult, but possible if you
travel slowly and carefully. A reminder for swamps however, watch out for
quicksand. That could end your trip real quick!
Obvious Exits :  East South West

J Beginning of a swamp
   Traveling is not as difficult as you feared and, so far, you haven't run
into any quicksand! Strange creatures dwell in this swamp, making this swamp
scarier than any you have ever been in before. The swamp gas is so strong you
feel as if you might be overcome by it. If you did pass out from it some
creature would surly kill you instantly.
Obvious Exits :  North South

K A foul smelling swamp
   A foul smelling gas erupts from the ground in this swamp. Hmmm funny thing,
swamp gas in a swamp! Seriously, the gas is so strong you feel as though you
might be overcome by the fumes. How anything could live in this place, you
really don't know. By the looks of things however, some creatures actually
prefer this environment.
Obvious Exits :  North East

L A foul smelling swamp
   Traveling is not as difficult as you feared and, so far, you haven't run
into any quicksand! Strange creatures dwell in this swamp, making this swamp
scarier than any you have ever been in before. The swamp gas is so strong you
feel as if you might be overcome by it. If you did pass out from it some
creature would surely kill you instantly.
Obvious Exits :  East West

M End of the swamp
   The swamp ends at a small forest glade. The glade to the east looks peaceful
and calm, you can actually hear the call of birds that you recognize. Perhaps
it will be a refuge in this horrible world. First, however, you must get to it
through the muck that makes up this place, no small task indeed.
Obvious Exits :  South West

N A forest glade
   What trees there are in this forest are small compared to those you saw on
the other side of the island. Its as if all the trees on this side were
destroyed and the plant eaters had to move on to the other side of the island.
That means that whatever lives here must be able to survive on a small amount
of plants or they don't feed on the plants at all...
Obvious Exits :  North East
Obvious Exits :  North East South

O A forest glade
   The glade continues here right up to the side of a volcano. From here at its
base you can tell it is no longer active like the other volcano on this island.
You wonder why only one of the two volcanoes would die, since they are so close
together. The steep stone slope of the volcano blocks any further progress to
the north.
Obvious Exits :  South West

P A forest glade
   The dried bones of some creature lay on the ground here, telling you that
something in this part of the forest has a taste for flesh. Lets just hope it
doesn't like human flesh, eh?
Obvious Exits :  North East

Q A forest glade
   A beautiful forest glade, free of the destruction caused by some of the
larger plant eaters, covers the southern part of the island. However, you'd
rather not think about what the creatures in this part of the forest eat if
they're not eating the trees...
Obvious Exits :  North South West
Obvious Exits :  South

R An ocean harbor
   This island had shown no sigh of a civilization until now. A magnificent
dock made of stone stands here on the ocean, and remains of buildings can be
found testifying that this place was used as some sort of harbor at one time,
however that must have been a long time ago. The only thing left is the stone
dock jutting out into the ocean.
Obvious Exits :  North South

S On the ocean
   Once again your on the ocean fighting the strange current that seek to push
you back to the island which you came from. The water is warmer than before
and you speculate that perhaps this is not the same ocean. Maybe you are on
the ocean as it was in prehistoric times, and maybe that means there'll be
prehistoric creatures in it....
Obvious Exits :  North East

T At the edge of a forest
   The plains meet a small forest here, providing you with some shelter from
the elements. But at what cost do you attain this shelter? So far there has
been danger at every step, will this step be any different? Will the forest be
the end of the road? Are you ever going to find out the answers to these
questions...
Obvious Exits :  East West

U On the plains of The Forgotten Island
   The plains stretch from the inactive volcano in the west, to the river in
the east and finally to the sea in the south. They are nothing but a great
expanse of open space, yet still they contain much hidden danger. The speed of
the creatures here allows you to see them, but not time to prepare for them.
Obvious Exits :  North East West

V The plains of The Forgotten Island
   You leave the deep, dark forest behind and head out onto the open plains of
this long lost island. You are high above the level of the sea, which you can
see from here. Not only do creatures roam the forest, you can see them
here and in the ocean too. Will you ever be able to leave them behind?
Obvious Exits :  East South
Obvious Exits :  North West

W Traveling the plains
  The wide open plains allow you to see creatures in the distance...
preventing them from surprising you as they did in the forest. Several of the
creatures you have seen are incredibly fast and use this speed effectively by
attacking in packs of 3 and 4, you should be cautious!
Obvious Exits :  North South West

X The plains of The Forgotten Island
   You leave the deep, dark forest behind and head out onto the open plains of
this long lost island. You are high above the level of the sea, which you can
see from here. Not only do mythical creatures roam the forest, you can see
them here and in the ocean too. Two strange stone pillars stand at the edge of
the cliff here and far in the distance you can see two identical pillars on
the distant shore of another island across the river.
Obvious Exits :  North (East) South

Y A forest path
   Some beast has made a path, several paths in fact, through this thick
forest. The lower branches and leaves of several trees look as though they have
been chewed and gnawed on. You dare to hope that whatever beasts live in this
forest they only eat the trees and not small humans like yourself.
Obvious Exits :  North South

Z A trail between the cliffs
   A large trail begins here. Its too large to have been made by any of the
creatures you have seen to use, only some type of humanoid could possibly
have made it. The path looks like it continues up the valley walls further on.
Obvious Exits :  South West

a A trail near the volcano
   The trail becomes rockier as it slowly ascends the slope of a huge active
volcano. The slope is devoid of foliage due to previous lava flows. A slight
rumble and a pillar of smoke, however, are the only signs that this is an
active volcano.
Obvious Exits :  North South West

b At the mouth of the volcano
   You are standing at the rim of a huge volcano. The steam that rises from
below is almost hot enough to melt the steal in your weapons, not to mention
your flesh! Below you, you can see the lava still bubbling in the cauldron, or
is that something else causing the lava to stir? a creature perhaps?
Obvious Exits :  North West Down
(unicorn was here, but probably roams)

c Inside the Volcano
   The hot lava makes the heat in this place almost too hot to handle. How
anything could survive in this place is beyond you! You certainly can't take
much more of it...why the H*ll did you come down here in the first place!? Oh
yeah that stirring in the lava. Well from down here you can tell that there is
something under the surface..but what, is the question!
Obvious Exits :  Up
the Phoenix (wings of the phoenix)

d A small valley
   The path leads you up the walls of this small valley to a point high above
the treetops. There are footprints in the dirt witch are obviously recent and
made by a humanoid. The valley is curved, like a crescent moon, and the path
follows the north-eastern wall, leading to what appears to be several caves in
the distance.
Obvious Exits :  North East

e A mountain path
   The small path continues here. You have to hug the wall and travel very
slowly, to avoid falling, in several places. This is one of those places you
don't want to look down! A fall would me certain death, perhaps you should
have taken those mountain climbing classes back in town, eh?
Obvious Exits :  North East West

f A cave
   You are in a large cave that appears to be used as a home. The cave is not
entirely natural, some of the walls have obviously been chipped away with
some sort of tool, and strange pictures have been drawn on the walls in
several places. There is a pit in the floor for building a fire and niches
have been carved in several places for storage. Necessity, not comfort,
dictates the layout of this home.
Obvious Exits :  South

g Corner of cave street
   The path gets wider here and has apparently seen much more use. The path
follows the valley as it takes a sharp turn to the south here. There are caves
to the north and east. Several buckets are here filled with water leading you
to believe that this is some sort of gathering place for the inhabitants of
this strange village.
Obvious Exits :  North East South West

h End of the path
   The end of the trail widens as you approach some very important looking
caves. The cave to the east is surrounded be drawings of skulls and Dragons!
all drawn in what appears to be blood. While the cave to the south is just the
largest of all the caves you've seen so far, no doubt someone (or something?)
important lives there.
Obvious Exits :  North East South

i The cave of the Shaman
   This cave must belong to the shaman of the village. Skulls litter the floor,
strange herbs hang from pouches from the ceiling, and pictures drawn in blood
cover the walls. A large stone alter is in the center of the room, apparently
so the patients have somewhere to die.. Pictures of a huge dragon, the largest
you've ever seen, covers one wall and several sigils of warding have been
scribed in blood around them.
Obvious Exits :  West

j The chief's cave
   This cave is so large and richly decorated that it must be the chief's home.
Furs from many different animals covering the floor, and a fire pit with a vent
to the outside, keep this cave significantly warmer than other caves you have
visited. Colorful pictures, made of plant dyes, tell the history of the tribe
forever preserving it on the stone walls.
Obvious Exits :  North (East)
the Stone giant chief (a large lionskin sash, a large stone key)

k The village treasure room
   This room is used to hide the treasures of the tribe. Paints made of plant
dyes, grain, crude grain alcohol, and treasure, lie in clay containers on the
floor. Dried meat hangs from the ceiling to make sure the tribe does not go
hungry if a food shortage should occur. Not much here is worth anything to a
civilized person, but you may be able to find something.
Obvious Exits :  West
A large sack of gold coins is here. (45000)

l On the ocean
   Once again your on the ocean fighting the strange current that seek to push
you back to the island which you came from. The water is warmer than before
and you speculate that perhaps this is not the same ocean. Maybe you are on
the ocean as it was in prehistoric times, and maybe that means there'll be
prehistoric creatures in it....
Obvious Exits :  East West
The dragon turtle (some seaweed)

m Mouth of the river
   A river is to the north that separates the main island with a much smaller
island. This is the connection between the river and the ocean. A small
waterfall allows the water from the river to join with the ocean and keeps the
ocean from polluting the freshwater of the river.
Obvious Exits :  North West

n The river
   The river is small and fast moving. Steep cliffs rise to either side of you
that prevent you from reaching either island. Effectively keeping you trapped
on the river. Below you dark shapes can be seen in the water, large dark
shapes....
Obvious Exits :  North South

o Source of the river
   The source of this river is apparently an underground spring, because the
water bubbles up from below. It is also a hot spring judging by the air
temperature and the steam rising off the water. Perhaps there is some
underground river or cave too, but that's for another area...

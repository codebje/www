Easiest in via Northern Mountain Range. TODO: directions.

a is "In the Air" with Bezgarath the Deceiver. Bit of a nasty one.
<wielded>            the Sword of Shadows
    artifact, +4 dam +2 hit 10mp det-align, usable by DK but not AS/MU, plenty of dice
Sword of Shadows is a meld part for a DK weapon
    needs sphere of absolute darkness from Xchantharus and steel from Troll King.
    A bar of flawless steel is being carried by the king of trolls.

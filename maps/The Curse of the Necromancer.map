--- notes

Rooms in the graveyard (past 0) marked '!' spawn an undead mob on entry.

Tell Niles (in 5) you want to help to open door to the Baron. Tell the Baron you're there for the Witch or Necromancer
and he'll tell you there's a reward for the Necromancer's defeat. Ask what proof is needed and the Baron will let you
know that he wants the heart of the Necromancer while Francois will reward you for the head of the Witch. If you
accept his tasks by saying yes he'll let you know that Maryah and Francois will have information.

Maryah just panics. Francois says the Witch is in the abandoned graveyard.

Push the altar north of 4 to open the passage down to 8; pull torch in 8 to open passage south.

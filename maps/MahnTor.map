A You wander, lost hopelessly. The mist swirls all about you. You can discern no
direction. You stumble blindly through the mist, oblivious to your
surroundings.

B You wander through the thick mist. It swirls all about you and makes it hard
to breathe. The ground below you makes a soft squishing sound as you trudge
on, but this noise is absorbed by the mist and does not travel. You can wander
in any direction.

C You stumble through the marsh here. The swamp seems to have swallowed you up
and denied you exit. This mist is your jailor. You cannot tell where you are.
You hear quiet laughter all about you.

D You wander, hopelessly lost. Swirling mist obscures your vision and clouds
your mind. You lose all concept of direction. Small, silent giggles can be
heard all around. You can wander in any direction.

E You try to peer through the mist......You see nothing. It swirls about you,
covering you in a damp sheen. There is no sound, all light is eagerly devoured
by the mist. You feel totally and hopelessly lost.

F You wander, lost, for what seems an eternity. Then....From nowhere....You see
what appears to be trees and hills to the east. The mist itself thickens to
the west, while it grows thin to the east.

G You are in a thick misty area. The mist swirls around you, seeming to taunt
you and dare you to escape. You feel a slight electric charge in the mist. It
almost caresses your body as it floats about you. You can wander in any
direction.......

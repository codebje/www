M: mirror to BlackHeart Keep

Can portal to 'a', though there is a hidden aggro (relatively low hp/damage) cobra in the room.
Portal point for remainder of dungeon is B.

Hidden, aggro leprechauns wander around in the section reached from B - expect 10 all up. Because there are two
one-way exits into C, many will wind up with the bloodbeast in there. Some will wind up past the waters near b/c.
They're relatively easy mobs for the zone, but don't let them catch you by surprise in big numbers.

The old man in f wants to be given something, presumably from the zone, but I do not know what. Tried:
    - a magnificent winged helm
    - a gold ring
    - a short throwing spear
    - a bone ring
    - a large pearl
    - a velvet bag
    - a crown

0 An Enchanted Path
   You seem to have stumbled upon an enchanted path. The path seems to glow
with a faint blue aura, and is actually floating inches above the forest
floor!

1 An Enchanted Path
   As you continue along the enchanted path you seem to be able to hear the
distinct sound of splintering wood coming from the north, while a roar from
a great dragon can be heard from the south. To the distant west you can make
out the faint outline of a magnificent castle.

2 An Enchanted Path
   As you continue to follow the enchanted path, you notice a smaller path
leading to the north, while the main path continues to the west. The distinct
sound of splintering wood can be heard to the north.

3 A Dangerous Path
   Oh no! You have wandered off of the main path! Go back before it is to late!

4 A Dead End
   You have entered a dead end in the small forest. You are surrounded
by an odd assortment of trees and plants. To the far north you see
a very tall and ugly man devestating trees with one big swipe of his
his massive fist. You suddenly realize that wandering off of the main
path was a HUGE mistake!

5 The Guards Hall
   You stand in the middle of a great hall. A high domed ceiling caps this
circular room. Fungas creeps down all the walls, covering tapastries
faded from recognition.
One-way down, all other exits back to start of zone

6 Castle Entranceway
   You are standing at the entranceway of Castle Roogne. All about the walls
are great tapestries that depict the history behind this great land. One
tapestry in peticular catches your eye ...it shows a scene in which a great
traveler stands before the gates of Castle Roogna ..wait ..thats you! You
are dumbfounded as you realize that this tapestry is recording you very own
personal history!

7 At The Castle Gates
   You stand before the great castle. As you walk closer you begin to realize
that this castle is constructed completly out of solid ebony. Standing next
to such a massive piece of architecure you suddenly realize how
insignificant your life truely is.

8 A Gravel Road
   You have reached the end of the gravel road. You notice that the road
continues back to the north, and the great castle is to the west. As you
look at the castle you are awe struck buy its shear beauty. You ponder
deeply about the fantastic treasures that must be inside.

9 A Gravel Road
   You are walking along a well worn path made completly of gravel. A large
white castle looms to the west...

A The Choice
   You have reached the end of the enchanted path. Smaller paths lead to the
north and south, while the main path continues back to the east.

B An Enchanted Path
   You are standing on an enchanted path. from the corner of your eye you
notice a path leading down, while the main path continues to the west. the
roar of a great dragon can be heard to the south.

C The Gap Chasm
  You are standing at the base of a great chasme that stretches as far as
the eye can see...
Gap Chasm maze: eswseewwnwn (Gap Dragon now north)

D The Lair Of The Gap Dragon
   You have just entered what is perhaps the most dangerous place in all of
Xanth. Scattered about the floor are the corpses of at least one thousand
men who foolishly tried to slay the Gap Dragon. All around you is the stench
of rot and decay. An odd feeling runs down your spine as you peer into the
face of death...

E A Small Path
   You are walking along a small path that leads to the north and continues
back to the south. To the east you see a large fearsome looking cloud that
appears to be in the shape of a human face ...WEIRD!?

F A Turn In The Path
   You have reached a turn in the path. A wise man would turn back now!
F1 one-way south into G

G End of the path
   You have reached the end of the path. Floating inches above your head is
the darkest, meanist, most vile looking cloud you have ever seen. As you
turn to flee you notice that you have nowhere else to go!

H A Hallway
   You stand in a brightly lit hallwy that runs down the middle of this
great castle. Fantastic murals adorn the walls on all sides of you. You
start to break out in a light sweat as you anticipate the wonderful
treasures that hide in this castle.

I A Room In The Castle
   You are in what appears to be a guest room of this great castle. A giant
bed rests against the northern side of this room, taking up more than half
of this luxurious room. Paintings by every great painter known to man covers
the walls of this magnificant room. The laughter of a child echos of the
castles walls. You decide to leave this room, and continue with your
adventure.

J A Hallway
   As you continue on your long journey down this brightly lite hallway
you feel a cool breeze coming from the north. The sweet aroma of roses
and iris' fill the hallway, and a giddy feeling of anticipation overtakes
you.

K Princess' Ivy's Bedroom
   As you walk into this room you at first think that you have stepped into
another realm. The walls here are completly covered with vines and ivy.
You then notice a strange an mystical aura that seems to engulf the plants...
they seem to be growing toward you ...maybe entering this castle wasn't
such a good idea after all ...then, out of the corner of your eye, you
see her...

L A Hallway
   You are standing in a well lit hallway that continues to the west, and
runs back to the east. To the north you hear what seems to be ...a party?

M Prince Dor's Bedroom
   As you enter this room you are blasted with every type of noise
immaginable. You hear shouting, cursing, singing, talking, whispering,
yoddeling, screaming, laughing, and crying. Never before have you
been subject to such an overwhelming sensation. As you peer around the
room you are shocked to find only one person occupying this room. He
has a nasty little grin smeared across his face...

N A Dimmly Lit Hallway
   As you walk further down the hallway you begin to notice that the rooms
are starting to get darker and darker. Even the once bright ebony stones
are begining to turn to more of a light yellow tint... You notice that
the hallway continues to the north, and back to the east.

O It Is Pitch Black Here...
   You have entered the realm of the dead! All around you is the putrid
stench of decaying corpses ...wait! Thats your breath you smell. Ok who
forgot to light the torches on the west side of the castle? Suddenly,
relieved by this revelation, you notice that the hallway continues to
the north, and back to the south.

P The King's Study
   This room is filled with more books than you have ever seen in your life.
From one side of the room to the other, you see shelves upon shelves of
books. In the middle of the room is a giant stone table with a every known
Peirs Anthony novel created. To one corner of the room you see a wrinkled
old lady.

Q A Hallway Going Nowhere
  You are walking along a long hallway that seems to be going nowhere...
You can see exits to the east and to the west.

R A Hallway Going Nowhere
   You are walking along a hallway that seems to lead to no particular
destination. A faint glow cascades off of the walls and lights your path.
Tapestries of all kinds adourn the walls, and etchings of ancient battles
can be seen overhead.

T The Throne Room Of King Trent
   You have entered the most beautiful room in all of Xanth. The floors
here are constructed out of the purest of silver. Hung upon the
walls are tapestries woven from golden threads. And you can see all of
Xanth as you peer out of the clearest and most radiant diamonds in the
land. You suddenly realize that you are not alone. You turn around
quickly, but it is to late. ....the last thing you remember is hearing
a man chuckle ever so softly...

S The Good Magician's Workshop
   This room stinks of sulpher, phosphate, and zinc. A very old, and very
cluttered desk stands in one corner of this small room, taking up more
space than it probably should. A large leather bound book rests upon
this desk, glowing with a fantastic white light.

U The Good Magician's Bedchamber
   You can see that this room is not for physical comfort. a lonely cot
rests on the western side of the room, while a huge desk covers nearly
the rest of the room. You see a small troll-like man hovering over a
great text. he sneers at you as you enter the room and yells, "What do
you want nitwit? Can you not see that I am busy now?"

a A Dark Pool
   Darkwater pours from the gapping holes in the ceiling above. You try to
peer into the Darkwater, but only see your own shimmering reflection. As
you ponder about this, a coin falls from your and dissolves in the thick
black liquid.
Loops except one way north (to b), probably had a trapdoor up

b The Runoff
   Here the frothing torrent of darkwater spills into small grates on
each side of the room. To the center of the room you you see a great
marble table, with a dozen wooden chairs on all sides of it. Exits
lead in all directions.
West to Midgaard, other cardinals one way to (c) End of a Dark Tunnel

c End of a Dark Tunnel
   The fragments of an ancient stone stairway hang five feet from the cavern
ceiling. A thin shaft of light overhead dimly outlines this dismal place.
Broken tables lie scattered about, and a fireplace, cold with disuse, is
built into the eastern wall.
one way up to d

d A Golden Prairie
   The tall wheat stalks of the prairie stand strongly on all sides of you.
The bright autumn sun warms your soul and a soft gentle wind blows from
the west. You stand on a path that seems very little used, and it leads to
the north.

e A Little Used Path
   As you walk along this little used path you begin to notice that this
prairie is teaming with life. Creatures of all shapes and color seem to
live of the nurishing stalks of wheat. To the north you see a small hill that
seems to dominate the landscape, while an over grown path to the east
barely catches your attention.

f A Hill on the Prairie
   From this vantage point you can see the entire prairie. As you look out at
the small prairie, YOU start to imagine that you are floating on a great
golden ocean. The wind softly rustles the golden stalks, and small waves
begin to appear as the stalks sway from side to side. To the far west you
can see a great castle, standing strong and proud. To the north you notice
a glowing pathway leading through a small forest. A great gap in the earth
lies to the southeast, and a huge storm cloud looms in the distance.

g An Over Grown Trail
   This was once the greatest path in all of Xanth, but now it is never
used. A great Oak tree lies in the middle of the path, blocking every
direction but the one from which you came.

h Through the Giant Stalks
  Great stalks of wheat surround you on all sides. The sun is starting to
take its toll on you. You better seek shelter at once.

i End of the Path
   You stand at the end of an old path that seemed used very little, if
at all. A path to the south leads to a great golden prairie of wheat,
while a huge cliff looms overhead. A great dragons roar can be heard
echoing off the walls of the cliff. The only exits seem to be the path
back to through the great prairie, or a risky climb up a steep cliff.
exit south loops

j A Steep Climb
   A clear mountain vally sprawls about you. From here you can see the
entire realm. To the northeast the great city of midgaard can be seen,
with a monstrous castle looming behind the great city. To the east
a flock of birds can be seen fleeing the Dark Woods. A great desert can
be seen to the north, with a huge pyramid at its center.

k A Small Cave
   This is nothing more than just a small niche in the steep slope. The
darkness of this cave leaves you with an erie sensation, and for some
reason make you feel very uncomfortable. A small path leads to the north,
with the cave entrance back to the east.

l Claustrophobia
   You feel as if the walls of this room are inching nearer by the
minute. You start to panic, but force yourself to remain calm. The
only exit is that to the north.

m A Wooden Staircase
   You are standing on an old withered staircase. The walls around you are
covered with a variety of mosses. A thick black substance drips from
the ceiling above.
Obvious Exits :  Down

n Halfway Down A Wooden Staircase
   You are standing on an old withered staircase. The walls around you are
covered with a variety of mosses. A thick black substance drips from
the ceiling above.
Obvious Exits :  Down

o The Bottom of a Wooden Staircase
   You are at the end of an old wooden staircase. A domed ceiling caps this
sixty foot tall circular room. Vines and mosses dangle from great cracks
in the walls. In the center of the room stands a great pedestal, the top
of which cannot be seen from the floor. Exits lead in every direction.
Obvious Exits :  North East South West Up
Loops N, S, W; up to A Fall From Grace

p A Fall From Grace
   Heavy, frayed gold cloth adorns the walls. Statues line the walls,
and carpets of every color and description form a patchwork across the
floor. At the west end, a huge throne sits, the gold leafing peeling
badly from its carved frame. A Hippogriff stares at you as you enter
the room. You feel your soul sinking to the depths of hell as his
razor sharp talons tear into you.

q A Hidden Tunnel
   You are walking down a long tunnel that seems to have no end. Rivulets
of water trickle down the walls of the room. Although a great deal of
water is flooding the room, that on the floor only seems to be a few
inches deep. Exits lead in all directions.
Loops E, S, W

r A Small Pool
   Torrents of water stream down from huge cracks in the ceiling and in the
walls. The room is at least half full now, and gaining by the minute. You
start to feel a small pain in every part of your body as the Dark Water
starts to eat its way into your delicate skin.
Dark Water, the horned lizard, the horned lizard, the horned lizard, the horned lizard, the Shadow Dancer Bodyguard

Entrance is below Goldmoon in Xak Tsaroth: portal/mist to `blood_hound`, up, south, all east, enter well, all north, and down.
The key is obtained by melding gold pieces from Redbeard in the Isles of the Pirate Lords, the three sisters in Asgard, Xyrtog
in Usurpers of Hochenyana, and the huge snarling panther in the Dark Friends Guild.
